Project Scope: My website is a centralized resource for information on cybersecurity breaches. It can help individuals and organizations stay up-to-date on the latest threats and provide guidance on how to protect themselves. In the future, the site could provide guidance on steps to take to mitigate the damage and recover lost data. Can be useful to small businesses and individuals who may not have the resources to employ a dedicated IT team.
